What did you do particularly well?
I thought the whole thing went pretty well. The program worked as intended.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think I could have doine a better job with the looping on this project. I feel I made it a little too complicated. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Figuring out all the math required for this was a little hard for me.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Knowing the code itself is beneficial if I choose to move forward with this language. Learning it was pretty tough.
